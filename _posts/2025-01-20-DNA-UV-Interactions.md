## Background

DNA is highly sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which can cause mutations and damage.

## Effects of UV on DNA

UV radiation can lead to the formation of thymine dimers, disrupting the DNA structure.

### Protective Mechanisms

Organisms have evolved repair mechanisms, such as nucleotide excision repair, to counteract UV damage.
