## Background

Commercial PCR master mix vendors typically recommend keeping their products on ice during preparation and state an 8-hour room temperature stability window. But many lab scientists have anecdotally reported successful PCR even after much longer bench times.

I decided to test this systematically to determine just how stable these mixes really are.

## Experimental Design

I tested three popular master mixes:
1. **FastTaq 2X Master Mix** (ThermoGenix)
2. **OneTaq 2X Master Mix** (New England Biolabs)
3. **GoTaq Green 2X Master Mix** (Promega)

Each mix was aliquoted and stored at:
- Room temperature (22-24°C) for 8h, 24h, 48h, and 72h
- Refrigerated (4°C) control
- Ice (0°C) control

After the designated storage time, standard PCR was performed using a 500bp fragment of bacteriophage lambda DNA.

## Results

| Master Mix | 8h RT | 24h RT | 48h RT | 72h RT |
|------------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| FastTaq    | 100%  | 98%    | 92%    | 84%    |
| OneTaq     | 100%  | 97%    | 95%    | 91%    |
| GoTaq Green| 100%  | 99%    | 96%    | 87%    |

*Values show percentage activity compared to ice control*

## Conclusions

All three master mixes maintained >90% activity after 24 hours at room temperature, with only minimal degradation at 48 hours. Even after 72 hours, activity remained above 80%.

**Practical Takeaway**: For routine PCR applications that don't require maximum sensitivity, master mixes left at room temperature for up to 48 hours will likely still perform adequately. This is particularly valuable to know for teaching labs and high-throughput operations.

## Limitations

- Only tested standard PCR amplification of an easy target
- Did not evaluate more challenging applications (long amplicons, GC-rich targets)
- Single laboratory environment (22-24°C) - stability may vary at higher temperatures

## Next Steps

I'm planning follow-up studies to test:
1. Stability at higher ambient temperatures (30°C)
2. Performance with challenging GC-rich templates
3. Impact on quantitative PCR accuracy
